# BoundTheBox

If a bound is needed, a box shall be provided!

BoundTheBox is an experimental project written to solve a small problem and try out new things. It's written in Angular just to make a few things easyer, but it uses mostly good old html, css and a touch of JS.

## Technical Debts

- Better split the pages into components
- Re-write some css to make the classes more reusable
- Unit test this whoooole project

##  Next steps
[] Make it possible to draw and control more than one bounding box
[] Make it possible to draw boxes backwards: currently is not possible to draw boxes going to the negative direction of the initual point
[] Fix layout for mobile devices
